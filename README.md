# SPI-Master-Core-Design
The goal of the SPI Master Core Design project is to create a hardware module that employs the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) protocol to allow serial communication between a master device and one or more slave devices.  The SPI Master core, which can be implemented in Verilog or VHDL, is intended to produce and control control signals including SS (Slave Select), MOSI (Master Out Slave In), and SCLK (Serial Clock).  In order to handle the communication states of the SPI protocol, the project entails creating a finite state machine (FSM) that supports features like customisable data rates, clock phase (CPHA), and changeable clock polarity (CPOL).  The core is optionally synthesised on an FPGA platform and evaluated and validated through simulation using programs like ModelSim or Vivado.
